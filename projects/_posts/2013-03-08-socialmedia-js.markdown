Socialmedia.js enables JavaScript SDKs and associated social media functions in web pages and apps. This library helps to replace the tedious routine of retrieving the SDK codes from developers sections, read the instructions and then having same block of code in each page of your website. The simple methods to initialize Socialmedia.js library give you complete control over what particular social media service you want to use but also ends the worries of having the SDK code duplicated in your pages which may result in unexpected errors.
